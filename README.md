# HLS-data-download
This code downloads HLS (Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2) data from NASA website. This dataset provides consistent surface reflectance from the Landsat 8, Sentinel-2A and Sentinal-2B satellites. The merged product has been run though a set of algorithms that include atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spatial co-registration and common gridding, illumination and view angle normalization, and spectral band-pass adjustment. The HLS dataset contains two products of surface reflectance at 30 m resolution:  HLSS30 from the Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites, and HLSL30 from the Landsat satellite. These two products are gridded into the same tiling system, the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) so that they can be stacked together to generate time series with more frequent observations. Old Woman Creek, which used as an example here, is fully covered by the tile at location code 17TLF. Data can be accessed through https://hls.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/.
